Day-2 Task:
•	What factors do you think had to come together to make one day on earth possible?
We know that even though there are lakhs of unique species on earth, humans are the only one species which differentiate themselves based on cast ,creed ,civilizations, race, colour, region etc..Though these barriers are created by humans themselves a common connection appears between each one of them which is the humanity.The food and cultures may differ but the hunger ,thirst,feelings are one and same for each one of them.Every humans ultimate goal is to meet their basic needs and be the best version of themselves in whatever they do.They are all one big species living on planet earth as a whole.Thus the unision of all humans as one race under one roof  inspite of cast ,colour ,region makes it possible for the directors to make one day on earth possible.
•	Do you agree with Ruddick that film is universal language ?why or why not?
I agree with Ruddick that film is a universally understood language as human emotions are understood by expressing feelings  rather than expressing through language.Human race as a whole is the composure of feelings.For example we can understand the pain of a hungry begger just by seeing him rather than by communicating him through language.Similarly a film brings itself  close to our heart because it potraits the human emotions no matter in which language it is made or which location it is shot.As like emotions are felt ,films also make people feel and bring home the point exactly.even though films are used as a source of recreation,they are also a source of inspiration and a source of beautiful portrayal of human emotions.Thus film is a universal language is justified.
•	In your opinion is it true that people all over the world are alike despite our outward differences.explain?
In my opinion it is true that people are alike despite of the outward differences.The human race as a whole demands the same things for their survival which include basic amenities like food ,water and clothing and are in need of love,care,happiness.They are composed of the same basic emotions like the love , hatred , envy, anger,etc..pople all over the world are in just need of love and care.As a human one requires to accomplish his goal and be his/her best version in what ever she /he does.The highest ideal of humans as a whole is always same that is to enlighten himself ,get untangled from worldly possessions and serve humanity through any way possible by him/her that is to be kind to the other people and serve the poor .Therefore as the main goal of humans is same and as they all are born to reach the same highest position i conclude that people all over the world are always under one roof and thus same.
