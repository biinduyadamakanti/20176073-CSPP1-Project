The Ancient lives project, is a project which gives the common people a chance to participate in translating  the ancient scripts into normal Greek language just by virtual presence .It helps the paleographers in their work and also involve the common people to participate in digging out the history. 
               In the ancient lives project, people(volunteers) help in decoding the  ancient scripts just by using their personal computers accessing from any corner of the world. They can do this by logging  into a website and   then just by checking each letter in the given script against the onscreen Greek keyboard and typing in when the match is found. After completing this work for a script, just upload the script to the project’s palaeographers.
