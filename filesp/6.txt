This Monday when i saw one of the episodes of the food factory  in discovery ,about how the tortillas are made ,i just fell more in love with it
      I just got tuned to the program as i was really interested in knowing how the complex machinery work in making my favourite food and what gets the taste to it
The anchor john hein adds flavour to the program by asking many interesting questions to the manufacturers which makes me  go awe.

So don’t forget to watch this show tonight with your family
